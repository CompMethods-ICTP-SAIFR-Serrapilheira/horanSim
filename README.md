# Objective

The objective of this repository is to execute simulations of Horan's model with and without spatial restrictions.

The implementation of Horan's model is based on:
* the Ricardo Martínez-Garcia's classes on "Stochastical Mathematical Modeling" during the Serrapilheira-ICTP QBio course;
* the description presented in the chapters of the book "NOVAK, M. A. Evolutionary dynamics: Exploring the equations of life. Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. 378 p., Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London, England, 2006".
